# Personal Website / Project Portfolio / Master Resume

## General
I created this personal website/portfolio for several reasons:
- To improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
- To have a single place to showcase all my education, experience, skills, achievements, and projects.
- To serve as a "master resume" that I can easily link to in applications.
- To enhance my design abilities and create a professional, aesthetically pleasing online presence.

## Features
- **Smooth Scroll:** Navigating through sections is seamless and smooth, enhancing user experience.
- **Single Page Layout:** All content is available on a single page, making it easy to access everything without reloading.
- **Dynamically Relocating Header/Navbar:** The header/navbar adjusts its position dynamically based on screen size.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes and devices.
- **JSON Data Integration:** My script.js file extracts data from JSON files, so any future updates will be smooth and seamless.
- **Secret Easter Egg:** For those of you that want to inspect my code, there's a simple puzzle for you to figure out!
