        "description": "As a member of the ASU Satellite Club, I had the awesome opportunity to help contribute towards writing some of the software for the cubesat that will be launching into space in 2025 as a part of NASA's CubeSat initiative. I researched and located the GPIO header on the hardware, referring to data sheets to identify the necessary pins for the project. I developed a watchdog program in C that monitors the software for anomalies and executes automatic recovery procedures in case of software malfunctions. Additionally, I implemented the GPIO interface to interact with the hardware, ensuring seamless communication between the software and the onboard hardware."
